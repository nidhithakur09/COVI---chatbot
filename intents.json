              "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your turn and follow local guidance.The virus can spread from an infected person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell."

              "It has been nearly two years since the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused an outbreak of respiratory disease (COVID-19) and pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has spread around the world, sickening more than 270 million people and killing 5.3 million. By now, you probably know more about viruses than you ever wanted to. But we are still learning more every day.

Anosmia (loss of smell) is a symptom. The most commonly reported symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and shortness of breath. However, as the disease has spread around the world, healthcare providers have noticed a few unusual symptoms, including loss of smell (anosmia) and decreased sense of taste (ageusia). In South Korea, 30% of people who tested positive for the virus said that loss of smell was their first major symptom. In Germany, more than 2 out of 3 confirmed cases included loss of smell and taste. Doctors recommend that anyone who experiences a sudden loss of smell or taste self-isolate and contact their healthcare provider.\n    Transmission electron microscope image of SARS-CoV-2\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe coronavirus that causes COVID-19\u00e2\u20ac\u201demerging from the surface of cells cultured in the lab.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for the affected individuals, but bad news for public health because asymptomatic people can unintentionally spread the virus to others.
